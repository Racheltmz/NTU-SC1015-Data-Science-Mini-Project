## Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are aircraft that are guided autonomously, by remote control, or by both means and that carry some combination of sensors, electronic receivers and transmitters, and offensive ordnance. They are used for strategic and operational reconnaissance and for battlefield surveillance, and they can also intervene on the battlefield.
